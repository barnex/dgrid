dgrid processes data for easy use with gnuplot's "splot" command.

dgrid's input is a list with 3 columns: x, y, value. The output is this data ordered so that gnuplot can make a 3D splot: the output data is sorted, newlines are inserted where needed and the data is on a structured grid (even if the input was unstructured). When the input is unstructured, or structured but with missing points, the missing data is replaced by the nearest neighbor value.

typical usage:
splot '<dgrid messydata.txt' with pm3d
